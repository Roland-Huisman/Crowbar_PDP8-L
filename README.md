# Crowbar_PDP8-L

This little project is a 5V crowbar power protection for the PDP8/L mini computer.
The trip level is approximately 5.8V. Please note that some PDP8/L powers have design fault.
At powering up the machine the power spikes. In my machine it spiked to 6.2V.
This will immediately trip this crowbar. So make sure that you modify the power first.
